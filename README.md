# README

This report is part of a tarball which contains the scripts, data and plots used
to evaluate various LTE scheduling algorithms using NS3. To reproduce the
outputs, enter the following at a terminal window after extracting the files
from the tarball. We assume that NS3 has been built from the git repository.

```bash
cp -r run.sh scripts /path/to/ns-3-dev/scratch
cd /path/to/ns-3-dev/scratch
chmod a+x run.sh
./run.sh
```

The script run.sh does the following.
1. It sets up the folders for data collection and figures.
2. It invokes the NS3 simulator with appropriate arguments to generate the
   required data from simulations.
3. It uses common GNU Linux utilities such as `gawk`, `cut`, `sort`, `seq`,
   `paste` to process the output traces and generate datasets for plotting.
4. Finally, it invokes gnuplot with the processed datasets in step 3 to generate
   the required graphs.

Data files generated by NS3 and processed datasets are placed in the data
directory, while generated graphs are placed in the figs directory.
